# Alphanumerical column data is also kept in memory, if it shall be retrievable or usable for queries.
# The following comma separated list starts with the SQL table name and then contains two entries for
# every compound table column that shall be known to this server. There are four mandatory structure columns,
# which are not listed hare, but must exist in the compound table: idcode, idcooords, fragfp, skelspheres.
# The 'compoundTable' property contains a comma separated list with full table name as
# '<db_name>.<table_name> <table_alias>', followed by two entries per table column: '[<type>]<display_column_name>'
# and '<database_column_name>'. Every table must contain exactly one primary key column.

# The 'bottleTable' property defines the database name and all columns of the bottle table, which shall
# be known to this server. The bottle table is the central table of the inventory database. It references
# the compound table and it may reference additional tables keeping details of locations, suppliers, etc.
# For every referenced table the bottle table must have a type in the format '[fk:<table_alias>.<column_name_pk>]'
# that describes the references table and its primary key column.
