# The server engine keeps all chemical structure information in memory to allow for fast structure searches.
# Alphanumerical column data is also kept in memory, if it shall be retrievable or usable for queries.
# The following comma separated list starts with the display name and the SQL table name of the compound table.
# Then it contains two entries for every alphanumerical column of the compound table, which shall be known to
# this server. In addition to the columns listed here, the database's compound table must contain four mandatory
# text columns, which contain the necessary encoded chemical structure information:
# idcode, idcooords, fragfp, skelspheres.
# The format of the following, comma separated, text string is as follows:
# The 1st entry is the display name of the compound table, i.e. the name shown in the user interface.
# The 2nd entry is the full SQL table name with alias as '<db_name>.<table_name> <table_alias>'.
# Then every table column is specified by two entries: '[<type>]<display_column_name>' and
# '<database_column_name>'. Every table must contain exactly one primary key column tagged with '[pk]'.
# Foreign key tags must contain the referenced column name as '[fk:<short table name>.<column name>]'.
# Other allowed tags are [text]', '[num]', and '[date]'. In addition a table may have one column with
# '[id]' tag that defines a text column containing unique and not null values, which may serve as row
# identifier shown to users. If no '[id]' column exists, then the primary key is used as visible row
# identifier.

# The 'bottleTable' property defines the database name and all columns of the bottle table, which shall
# be known to this server. The bottle table is the central table of the inventory database. It references
# the compound table and it may reference additional tables keeping details of locations, suppliers, etc.
# For every referenced table the bottle table must have a type in the format '[fk:<table_alias>.<column_name_pk>]'
# that describes the references table and its primary key column.
